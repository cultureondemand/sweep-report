      This framework and functionality is based on this: https://github.com/vlandham/scroll_demo
      For a full rundown of the theory behind it, see: http://vallandingham.me/scroller.html
      We have tweaked to make it populoate more dynamically, and include interactive goodies like
      WebGL, SVG, etc. in the <vis> div created for the original interactive it was intended for.

  <span class="opening">
  <p>Educators, families, and policymakers have known for some time that the academic achievement gap is in large part due to an opportunity gap. Experts agree that accessible, high quality after school and summer learning programs are an essential set of opportunities that can help to close the achievement gap and create more equitable educational outcomes for kids where differences in race, culture, and family income have too often been predictive of acute disparities. For after school and summer programs to do their work, they need to meet kids where they are: in schools, and where kids live, play, and socialize.  Right now, some of the most important work to meet kids where they are with expanded learning opportunities is happening where they live, in affordable and public housing settings.</p>
  </span>

<p>
The Partnership for Children &amp; Youth (PCY), through our HousED Initiative, has spent years working with housing providers throughout California, enhancing the quality of learning in programs that collectively serve over 40,000 kids. HousED has also partnered with visionary leaders in housing to plan the future of capacity building, quality improvement, and enhanced public support for housing’s role in building greater equity in academic and life outcomes for young people from under-resourced families.</p>
<p>
In 2015, we brought together a diverse group of housing agencies and educators to meet an ambitious goal: establish standards for quality expanded learning programs that speak to the unique needs and challenges of prodviding services to youth in public and affordable housing communities. The Quality Standards for Expanded Learning in California produced by the California Department of Education and the California Afterschool Network served as a strong foundation for us and our early partners; the National Afterschool Association, Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, The David P. Weikart Center for Youth Program Quality, and the Housing Development Consortium to use, adapt, and share our work.</p>
<p>
These standards are a groundbreaking step forward. We are already seeing the impact these ideas are having on expanded learning programs in housing, and we look forward to hearing how you will use them. Every program is different, and we believe that these standards will serve as a guide that staff at each program will adapt to meet their unique needs.</p>
<p>
We hope you will join us, and make these standards your own. Together, we will change the lives of youth in expanded learning programs across the country. Together, we will build pathways out of poverty.

<p>The Partnership for Children &amp; Youth's HousED network adapted the California Department of Education’s Quality Standards for Expanded Learning Programs to reflect  the unique needs and realities of expanded learning programs in public and affordable housing communities. These ground breaking new standards leverage the unique opportunities providers have to build greater equity in educational (and broader life) outcomes for youth in housing. This was a group undertaking involving more than 50 educators, housing representatives, and stakeholders from across the country. Participants included every level of youth work, from direct service providers to senior executives to academic researchers and policy leaders. This diverse group added a unique housing-focused lens to the work of the nearly 500 people who reviewed the initial standards produced by the California Department of Education.
</p>
  </span>
<p>
Workgroup members were invited to offer input at one of three levels:
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigblues">Developers</span>—responsible for the initial adaptation
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigblues">Reviewers</span>—responsible for vetting and supplementing the adapted standards
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigblues">Endorsers</span>—responsible for signing off on the standards, and ensuring they support high quality youth services
</p>

<p>
The Developers first met in November 2015 for a two-day retreat focused entirely on adapting the original standards. A first draft of the revised standards emerged from that retreat, beginning to address the unique nature of expanded learning programs in public and affordable housing communities. Most notably, a focus on family engagement and program management emerged as critical points which had to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
For the next several months, the Developers worked to align the standards with the realities they faced each day in their programs. The importance of family engagement in housing communities made it clear that it should be a completely new standard, created specifically for housing providers.
</p>
<p>
In February 2016, the draft standards were unveiled at the HousED Summit, with workshops aligned to the standards. This also marked the beginning of several rounds of revisions, as the Reviewers gave feedback and suggestions. Based on their comments and revisions, the standards were sent to several agencies for endorsement. We are thrilled to partner with our Endorsers to share these standards on a national level.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the hard work of everyone involved, the Quality Standards for Expanded Learning in Public and Affordable Housing reflect the views of 13 different housing providers, educational organizations, and housing authorities.
